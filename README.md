# jsCharPick
a simple HTML/Javascript character picker

# What is it?
This is a minimalist implementation of a HTML/Javascript special character picker.

Imagine that you have a website with a number of text input fields and that you want to offer your users an easy way to input certain special characters. They might not have those special characters on their keyboards and would therefore appreciate to be able to pick them from a list. That is what jsCharPick does. It slides in a list of special characters (which you can easily change or extend in the JS code) from the top of the page and the user's choice is then added to the input or textarea field at the position of the caret.

Note that you need to focus one of the input fields first, otherwise it does nothing.
